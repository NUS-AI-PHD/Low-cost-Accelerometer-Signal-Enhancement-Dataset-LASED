Low-cost Accelerometer Signal Enhancement Dataset (LASED)

Paper: HEROS-GAN: Honed-Energy Regularized and Optimal Supervised GAN for Enhancing Accuracy and Range of Low-Cost Accelerometers

We have open-source a portion of the dataset, which includes 100 low-cost accelerometer signal samples and 100 high-quality accelerometer signal samples.

Low cost accelerometers are derived from the built-in inertial measurement units in smartphones, with a unit price not exceeding $0.5 per unit;

High cost accelerometer comes from the Xsens brand, with a unit price exceeding $1000 per unit.

Each signal sample is a 3 Ã— N time series and can be loaded by 'np. loadtxt'.
